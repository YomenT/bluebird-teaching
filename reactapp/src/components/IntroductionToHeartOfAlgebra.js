                        Most would call this portion of the SAT the "easiest", but the Heart of Algebra covers a lot of content from late middle school 
                        and early high school; students often complain that they forgot some of the content.  Therefore, don't be discouraged if you 
                        find this portion to already be a bit challenging.  We are here to help!
