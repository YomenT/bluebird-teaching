                        If you're still having any trouble at all with combining like terms (the previous section), I would try to focus on that for a bit 
                        more for now.  Combining like terms is an essential foundational skill.  A lot of future lessons will use combining like terms in 
                        some way.  Gotta make sure your foundation is strong before building on it.  Always reach out if you need any help!
