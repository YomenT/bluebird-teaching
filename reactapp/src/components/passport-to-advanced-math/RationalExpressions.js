                            <strong>What are rational expressions?</strong>  To be honest, the best way I can define them for you is they are fractions that can 
                            have variables in the numerators and/or denominators.  This is relavent to the SAT because they will have questions involving operations 
                            (adding, subtracting, multiplying, dividing) with rational expressions, and these questions also frequently involve simplifying them.

                            In this lesson, we're going to look at adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing rational expressions.  We'll leave the simplifying 
                            part for part 2.

                            Since rational expressions are fractions, you're going to need to remember your fraction rules when it comes to adding, subtracting, multiplying, 
                            and dividing.  If you forgot, don't worry at all.  I strongly recommend you take some time to brush up on that; it shouldn't take long at all.

                            <strong>Adding rational expressions</strong>, like adding normal fractions requires having a common denominator.  We achieve this in the same way 
                            we do with normal fractions.  Take a look at the two examples below to see how I get common denominators.

                                Again, we'll go line by line.  The first line just contains the original problem; we're trying to add those two rational expressions.  
                                The second line is where I'm trying to get common denominators.  I multiply the top and bottom of the left fraction by (x - 2), and I 
                                multiply the top and bottom of the right fraction with (x + 2).  The third line shows what everything looks like at this point; you'll 
                                see that both fractions now have common denominators.  In the fourth line; to the left of the equal sign, I have FOILed the numerators 
                                of both fractions, and now I can go about normally adding fractions.

                                We follow the same steps we do when we're multiplying fractions: multiply straight across all the numerators involved, and multiply all 
                                the denominators involved.  Basically just multiplying straight across.  This is where we need to remember FOILing and distribution.  We 
                                need to foil the two binomials in the numerators, and we need to distribute the two denominators.  Going line by line, in the first line, I 
                                have the original multiplication problem.  In the second line, I'm FOILing the numerators, and in the third line, I'm distributing the 
                                denominators.  Now that's all done, I just put the product of the numerators on the numerator of the new fraction, and I put the product of 
                                the denominators on the denominator of the new fraction.  This is shown as the final product in the fourth line (boxed).

                                I might try to re-orient this lesson.  In the mean time, we'll see in the lesson where we discuss simplifying rational expressions why we 
                                sometimes simplify the numerators/denominators, and why we sometimes leave then as the products.  <i>As always, reach out with any questions.</i>

                                fraction, and I changed the operation to multiplication (following the steps to dividing fractions).  From there, I went ahead and distributed 
                                the 5 across the first numerator.  This time I did not distribute the denominators; I just left them as factors.  Again, it'll become more

                        A lot of what we went over this lesson builds on existing fraction rules.  Now I know that we tend to forgot those fraction rules 
                        (myself included), so for this lesson, create a diagram that shows two examples for each scenario: addition, subtraction, multiplication, 
                        and division.  For each scenario, give two exampels: the first example should show solving a simple fraction problem (highlighting the 
                        steps required), and the second example should show the same scenario with a rational expression (showing the added steps in addition to 
                        the original required fraction rules).

                        Take a look at the picture below as an example.  I did just one of the scenarios (addition).  You would need to come up with examples for the 
                        rest of the three scenarios.
