                        Part 1 of exponent rules was to get you familiar with the 5 exponent rules.  In part 2, we're going to look at how the SAT uses a 
                        combination of exponent rules in a single problem.  A single simplication problem is going to involve many steps; each step involving 
                        an exponent rule.

                        Once you get better with these problems, you'll start doing several of the steps all in your head. For now though, let's do these 
                        problems one step at a time.  When going through these problems you just need to remember, you know all the different exponent rules now; 
                        you just need to utilize them in the right way.

                        <strong>Note: </strong> In my opinion, this is one of the harder areas in the SAT math section.  This is definitely a good time to 
                        reach out for help if you ever need any.

                        Watch the following video on exponent rules.  This video covers the basic exponent rules we discussed in part 1, but he teaches it 
                        in a slightly different way; however, results should be the same.  It's a very good idea to pause the video and try the problem yourself; 
                        resume the video once you've gotten an answer or are stuck.    
                    </p>

                    We really need to replace this with a 
                    more accurate video for what we're trying

                    The video should contain problems where 
                    we involve multiple exponent rules in a 
                    single simplification problem.
