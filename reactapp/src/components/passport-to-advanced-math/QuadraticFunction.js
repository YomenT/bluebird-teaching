                        From the equation being in standard form, we can use a little formula to quickly find the axis of symmetry.  For 
                        a parabola, the axis of symmetry is a vertical line right at the vertex.  Below is the formula we use to find the 
                        axis of symmetry (given the quadratic equation is in standard form), and a picture showing what the axis of symmetry 
                        looks like.  <i>Please forgive my awful drawing skills.</i>

                        The dashed line cutting the parabola in the middle is the axis of symmetry.  It makes both sides of the graph symmetrical.  
                        Not sure if you can read my handwriting, but if the vertex is at (3, -2), then the axis of symmetry can be represented by 
                        the line x = 3.

                        I know these might seem like very odd facts to know about quadratics, but the reason I'm sharing them with you is because there 
                        might be questions that require you know know these couple of odd facts.  I know it seems stupid memorizing these odd facts, but 
                        it's really worth your time.

                        These questions seem different; maybe even harder?  That's because some of the following questions are very good examples of 
                        real SAT questions you might face.  We'd be very interested in hearing how these questions go for you.  Were they very hard, got 
                        completely stuck, or they were actually easy?
