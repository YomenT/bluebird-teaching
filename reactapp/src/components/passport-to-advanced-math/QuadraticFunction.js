                        From the equation being in standard form, we can use a little formula to quickly find the axis of symmetry.  For 
                        a parabola, the axis of symmetry is a vertical line right at the vertex.  Below is the formula we use to find the 
                        axis of symmetry (given the quadratic equation is in standard form), and a picture showing what the axis of symmetry 
                        looks like.  <i>Please forgive my awful drawing skills.</i>

                        The dashed line cutting the parabola in the middle is the axis of symmetry.  It makes both sides of the graph symmetrical.  
                        Not sure if you can read my handwriting, but if the vertex is at (3, -2), then the axis of symmetry can be represented by 
                        the line x = 3.
