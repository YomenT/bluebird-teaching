                        Let's start this "hard" portion of the SAT nice and easy; we'll spend these next few sections learning about polynomials.  In this particular 
                        section, we're going to talk about combining like terms within a polynomial.  We're going to have a bunch of expressions containing at least 3 terms 
                        (since that's what a polynomial is), and we're just going to see if any of the terms will combine to simplify the expression as much as possible.

                    <p className="p-body-small">
                        In an expression, terms can combine if they have the same variable (or no variable), <strong>and</strong> they have the same exponent.

                        Keep in mind that in the SAT, you're probably not going to get a lot of questions where you just have to combine like terms.  Combining 
                        like terms is a skill we need to develop to work with harder problems; it's something you're usually going to want to do whenever 
                        working with expressions in the SAT.

                            For as many times as you like, randomly select any number of flash cards, and turn them over to see the terms.  
                            Move the flash cards around to make an expression with the terms, and see if you can combine any like terms.
