                        We're going to look more into what quadratic equations look like when they are graphed.
                    </p>

                    <p className="p-body-small">
                        Specifically, we're going to look at how different operations on a quadratic function change how the graph would look.  We've looked at graphing 
                        quadratics using vertex form, but this time we're just going to do a graphical analysis; for example, what graphical 
                        difference would there be between x<sup>2</sup> + 1 = y and -x<sup>2</sup> + 1 = y?  Basially we're going to learn what assumptions we can make 
                        on how a graph of a quadratic equation might look based on certain features in its standard form.
                    </p>

                    <p className="p-body-small"><strong><i>Why are the equations set to y and not 0?</i></strong>  Simply put, when we are factoring/solving, we get all the x's on one side, 
                    and we set the equation equal to 0.  When we are graphing, we still move all the x's to one side, but we set the equation equal to y.</p>

                    <p className="p-body">
                        Take a look at the graphs below; let's analyze the difference(s).

                        There is only one difference.  The one that had a positive x<sup>2</sup> opened upward, and the one with a negative x<sup>2</sup> opened downward.  Let's 
                        break this down.
                    </p>

                    <p className="p-body-small">
                        Remember the standard form we learned about in the last lesson (ax<sup>2</sup> + bx + c = 0)?  In the equations we used, there is no "bx", but that's not 
                        needed; we'll get into its importance later.  Whether "bx" is there or not, if the "a" value is positive, the graph opens upward; if the "a" value is 
                        negative, the graph opens downward.
                    </p>

                    <p className="p-body">
                        What about the "c" value?
                    </p>

                    <p className="p-body-small">
                        The "c" value dictates the y intercept of the graph (vertex).  In the example equation, the "c" value is 1, so the y intercept is 
                        right at y = 1 or (0, 1).  If we had the same exact equation, but the "c" value was -4, the y intercept would be at y = -4 or (0, -4).  It just 
                        so happened that the vertex and y intercept are at the same place.  That's not always the case.
                    </p>

                    <p className="p-body-small">
                        <i>What about horizontal positioning of the vertex?  Will the x value of the vertex always be 0?</i>  No, the x value is not always 0 for the vertex.  
                        It's just that in this example equation above, the x value of the vertex is 0.  If we had a "bx" term, then the vertex would not be on the y axis anymore.  
                        Don't worry about that for now though; we'll get to that later.  All you have to know for now is that a "bx" term will shift the center of the graph of 
                        the y axis (moving it right or left).
                    </p>

                    <p className="p-body-small">
                        The important takeaways from this lesson are the effects of positive/negative "a" values, and the effects of positive/negative "c" values.
