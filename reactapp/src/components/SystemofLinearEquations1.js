                        This is also going to be a very important part in the Heart of Algebra.  Remember learning about substitution and elimination?  That's what 
                        this stuff is all about.  Given a system of two linear equations, you should be able to solve using substitution or elimination.

                        <strong>What does solving mean?</strong>  In this case, solving a system of equations is finding the point at which they intersect.  
                        If you solve a system of two linear equations, you are finding the point at which they intersect.  It might sound a bit silly to explain 
                        this, but we don't want to fall into the trap of just doing things without knowing why.
