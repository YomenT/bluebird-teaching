                        Let's expand what we know about linear equations to address another group of questions involving them.  The Heart of Algebra will have 
                        some questions that target specific knowledge about linear equations: relationships between parallel and perpendicular lines.  Think to 
                        yourself about this for a second: if I have 2 linear equations, in terms of slope and y-intercept, what would make them parallel to each 
                        other if I were to graph them?  Any assumptions you can make about two perpendicular lines?

                    <p className="p-body-small">
                        <strong>To break this down, let's first look at two parallel lines</strong>.  Two parallel lines means that the <strong>slopes</strong> of 
                        the two linear equations <strong>are the same</strong>, and the <strong>y-intercepts</strong> are <strong>different</strong>.
                    </p>
                    <p className="p-body-small">
                        <strong>Now let's consider perpendicular lines</strong>.  Two lines that are perpendicular don't have any correlation when it comes to 
                        y-intercepts, but their <strong>slopes</strong> are going to be <strong>opposite and reciple</strong>.  <i>What does this mean?</i>  This means that if one 
                        line has a slope of 3/4, the other line has to have a slope of -3/4 to be perpendicular.

                        Do not overthink this!  Think of what we talked about earlier and try it.  Start with parallel if you're stuck.  There are many possible 
                        parallel equations, but just try to come up with one.  Take a look below once you've found an answer or you're stuck.

                        Just any equation with the same slope works.  Just as long as the slope is the same, and the y-intercept is different, then the lines are
