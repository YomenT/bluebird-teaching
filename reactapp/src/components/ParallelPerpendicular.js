                    Let's expand what we know about linear equations to address another group of questions involving them.  The Heart of Algebra will have 
                    some questions that target specific knowledge about linear equations: relationships between parallel and perpendicular lines.  Think to 
                    yourself about this for a second: if I have 2 linear equations, in terms of slope and y-intercept, what would make them parallel to each 
                    other if I were to graph them?  Any assumptions you can make about two perpendicular lines?

                <p className="p-body-small">
                    <strong>To break this down, let's first look at two parallel lines</strong>.  Two parallel lines means that the <strong>slopes</strong> of 
                    the two linear equations <strong>are the same</strong>, and the <strong>y-intercepts</strong> are <strong>different</strong>.
                </p>
                <p className="p-body-small">
                    <strong>Now let's consider perpendicular lines</strong>.  Two lines that are perpendicular don't have any correlation when it comes to 
                    y-intercepts, but their <strong>slopes</strong> are going to be <strong>opposite and reciple</strong>.  <i>What does this mean?</i>  This means that if one 
                    line has a slope of 3/4, the other line has to have a slope of -3/4 to be perpendicular.

                    1.  Consider the equation y = 5x - 3.  Write one possible parallel equation and one possible perpendicular equation.

                <p className="p-body-small">
                    Do not overthink this!  Think of what we talked about earlier and try it.  Start with parallel if you're stuck.  There are many possible 
                    parallel equations, but just try to come up with one.  Take a look below once you've found an answer or you're stuck.

                <p className="p-body-small">
                    Possible parallel equations:

                    <li>y = 5x - 1</li>
                    <li>y = 5x + 3</li>
                    <li>y = 5x - 5</li>
                    <li>y = 5x + 1000</li>

                <p className="p-body-small">
                    Just any equation with the same slope works.  Just as long as the slope is the same, and the y-intercept is different, then the lines are 
                    parallel.
