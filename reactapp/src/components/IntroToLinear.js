                        While it is very likely that you've covered all about linear functions in current/previous math courses, we're going to break down linear 
                        functions piece by piece.  There are quite a few things to remember, so we're going to break this into chunks.  Below is what you'll need to 
                        be able to recall off the top of your head for now.

                        <li>The <i>standard form</i> (or slope intercept form) of a linear function is <strong>y = mx + b</strong></li>

                                <li>The <strong>m</strong> represents the slope.</li>

                            </ul>
                        <li>The <i>slope</i> measures the steepness of a line.  It is also known as the rate of change.  Slope is also often defined 
                        as <sup>rise</sup>&frasl;<sub>run</sub>.</li>
                        <li> Below is the equation to find slope given two points</li>

                        The tricky part is that we won't always be given two points to find a slope like that.  In word problems, they're going to just give a 
                        bunch of information, and we're going to have to extract the two points from the information in the word problem.  Take a look at the 
                        example problem below and try it.

                        3.  Will started a new job as a cashier at a nearby bakery where he gets paid at the end of everyday.  He noticed that after a 6 hour 
                        shift, he had $76.50 deposited into his bank account.  Then after a 8 hour shift, he noticed a deposite of $102.00.  What is Will's hourly 
                        wage at the bakery?  Assume that Will hasn't withdrawn any money.

                        Try to think of a similar scenario to the last problem about Will.  Try to think of a situation like Will's that you could model using 
                        a linear equation.  I know we haven't talked much about the y-intercept yet, but try to identify a slope in a past experience.
