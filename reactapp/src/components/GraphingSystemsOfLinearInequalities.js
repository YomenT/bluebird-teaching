                <p className="p-body">
                    Remember when we worked with systems of linear equations with all the substitution and elimination?  Well with systems of linear 
                    inequalities, we don't really have to utilize substitution or elimination; we really just have to worry about our graphing skills.

                <p className="p-body-small">
                    Like with systems of linear equations, graph the two linear inequalities given in a systems problem like you would graph as we discussed right 
                    in the previous section; including the shading step.  The goal here is to find the common shaded area from both graphs.  If asked, any 
                    set of ordered pairs within that common shaded area would be conidered a solution to the system of linear inequalities.  Listed below are the steps 
                    I took to graph the two linear inequalties shown in the picture.  Notice that the steps are almost exactly the same; except there is one added part.

                <ol className="p-body">
                    <li>Solve for y for both inequalities(if needed).</li>
                    <li>
                        Graph the inequalities as if it were a regular linear equation.  Remember which inequalities utitilize solid or dashed lines?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Shade the region that satisfies the y values for the given inequalities.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Identify the common shaded area from both inequalities.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                    I want you to graph 8y - 4x > 2 and 3x - 4y > 2, and find the common shaded area.  You might have noticed that these are actually two inequalities 
                    that we've already worked with before.  The only difference now is that we're putting them together in a system to find the common shaded area.  Circle 
                    the answer choice below that matches the correct graph for the system of linear inequalitites.
